# FICstagram

FICstagram is a [Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)) project for the subject Programming II (2nd semester of Freshman year). Since I've already finished and turned in this assignment, I decided to make it public. Contributions are not allowed for obvious reasons. The final grade was a 2/2.
